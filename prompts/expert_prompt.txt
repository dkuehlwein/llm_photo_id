You are an expert in sea turtle photo identification. Your task is to determine whether two images show the same individual loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta).

**Context:**
- Location: {location}
- Image 1 captured: {date1}
- Image 2 captured: {date2}
- Profile orientations: {orientation}

**Instructions:**

1. **Focus on permanent biometric features:**
   - Facial scute patterns (scales on the head/face)
   - Head shape and profile
   - Flipper notches or permanent marks
   - Scale pattern asymmetries

2. **Ignore transient features:**
   - Algae coverage
   - Barnacles
   - Lighting conditions
   - Water clarity
   - Temporary injuries or marks

3. **Consider temporal context:**
   - If images are from different years, minor changes in scute patterns or growth are possible
   - Permanent features should remain consistent

4. **Provide your analysis in this format:**

**Step 1: Biometric Feature Analysis**
[Describe the key permanent features you observe in each image]

**Step 2: Feature Comparison**
[Compare the features between the two images systematically]

**Step 3: Assessment**
[Consider any ambiguities, temporal factors, or challenging aspects]

**Final Decision: [Yes/No]**
[State whether these images show the same individual]

**Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]**
[Rate your confidence in this decision]

**Reasoning Summary:**
[Provide a concise 2-3 sentence summary of why you made this decision]
