# YOUR TASK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Compare two sea turtle images and their associated metadata to determine if they show the same individual animal. Provide a definitive assessment with confidence level and detailed reasoning.

**Photo Metadata:**
- Location: {location}
- Date 1 (Image 1): {date1}
- Date 2 (Image 2): {date2}
- Orientation: {orientation}

# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## STEP 1: Image Quality Assessment

First, evaluate both images for quality:

**Check for:**
- Sharp focus on the head/face area (⚠️ CRITICAL - blurry images cannot be reliably identified)
- Viewing angle - perpendicular or near-perpendicular to the head surface is optimal (within 30° acceptable)
- Resolution - can you clearly see individual scale boundaries and edges?
- Obstructions - sand, barnacles, algae, turtles' own flippers or shadows covering facial scales
- Lighting - sufficient to distinguish scale patterns

⚠️ If either image has poor quality (out of focus, extreme angle, very low resolution), immediately flag this and reduce confidence.

## STEP 2: Facial Scale Pattern Analysis (PRIMARY IDENTIFIER)

🔑 **GOLD STANDARD for identification** - Facial scale patterns are like fingerprints: unique to each individual and stable for life.

**Focus on these head regions:**

1. **Post-ocular scales** (immediately behind the eyes)
   - Count the number of scales
   - Note their arrangement pattern
   - Look at their geometric shapes

2. **Tympanic scales** (large lateral area between the post-ocular scales and the neck)
   - ⭐ This is the MOST distinctive region
   - Examine the geometric pattern formed by scale boundaries
   - Look for unique intersection points
   - Note any irregular patterns or "orphan lines"

3. **Prefrontal scales** (top of head)
   - Count and arrangement
   - Pattern of divisions
   - Look for extra scales between the prefrontal scales (interprefrontal scales)

4. **Sub-temporal scales** (above tympanic region)
   - Pattern arrangement
   - Scale shapes and boundaries

**How to compare:**
- Look at the GEOMETRIC PATTERNS formed by scale edges and intersections
- Look for skin and pigmentation color similarities but be aware of the fact that pigmentation can change over time
- Focus on the ARRANGEMENT and SHAPES of scales
- ⚠️ Left and right sides of the same turtle have DIFFERENT patterns - prefer to compare the same side (left to left, or right to right)
- If you are comparing opposite sides you can speculate that they belong to the same individual if the pattern is similar even though it will not be 100% the same
- Look for matching "fingerprint-like" patterns - unique configurations of scale boundaries

**Species-specific notes:**
- **Loggerheads:** Easiest to identify - highest pattern variability, many tympanic scales
- **Green turtles:** Moderate variability - lateral (side) patterns are most distinctive
- **Hawksbills:** Most challenging - lowest variability, patterns mainly in lower posterior tympanic region
- **Leatherbacks:** Cannot use facial scales (have leathery skin) - must use pink pineal spot on top of head instead, or the spot configuration on its skin

## STEP 3: Secondary Visual Features (SUPPORTING EVIDENCE ONLY)

⚠️ These features can support a match but should NEVER be the primary basis for identification.

**✓ Use as confirmation:**
- **Deep permanent injuries/scars** - boat strikes, shark bites, notches in shell edge
  - These are excellent supporting evidence
  - Note: surface injuries may heal completely within a few months
- **Flipper scale patterns** - especially useful for hawksbills
  - Similar geometric analysis as facial scales
  - Less validated long-term but shows promise

**✗ DO NOT rely too much on:**
- Barnacle patterns (change within weeks/months). But do rely on them if you know that the photos were taken a few weeks apart
- Algae/biofouling (temporary)
- Carapace pigmentation (changes with growth and age)

## STEP 4: Metadata Analysis

Evaluate the plausibility of the match based on contextual information:

### Geographic Distance
*(Note: we could also omit that for the first experiments since all photos are from loggerheads in Zakynthos)*

**High confidence if:**
- Hawksbills: < 1 km apart (very small home ranges on specific reefs)
- Green turtles: < 50 km apart at foraging grounds (small, discrete home ranges)
- Loggerheads: < 100 km apart (larger, more plastic ranges)
- ANY SPECIES: Exact same location (GPS within 100m)

**Moderate confidence if:**
- Greens: 50-200 km apart within known foraging region
- Loggerheads: 100-500 km apart
- Sighting at foraging ground + sighting at nesting beach separated by known migration distance (hundreds to thousands of km during breeding season)

**Low confidence if:**
- 1,000 km apart within days/weeks outside breeding season (unlikely)
- Cross-ocean sightings without migration context

⭐ **Important:** Sea turtles show EXTREME site fidelity - they return to the same foraging grounds for years to decades. Same location is a STRONG positive indicator.

### Time Interval

**Expected re-sighting intervals:**
- 1-5 years: Normal and expected
- 5-10 years: Common
- 10-15 years: Documented, less common but plausible
- 15+ years: Rare but possible - patterns remain stable

**Breeding migration timing:**
- Adults migrate to nesting beaches every 2-5 years
- Can be hundreds to 2,000+ km from foraging grounds during nesting season
- Post-nesting migration takes ~23 days on average

⚠️ Do NOT reject matches based solely on multi-year gaps - these are normal and expected.

### Size Consistency

Must be compatible:
- ✓ Same size or larger in later photo = Compatible
- ✗ Smaller in later photo = Incompatible (indicates different individuals or measurement error)
- ✓ Rapid growth between photos = Compatible if adequate time passed and appropriate age class (juveniles grow quickly)

**Age classes:**
- Juveniles (1-10 years): Rapid growth
- Sub-adults (10-25 years): Moderate growth
- Adults (25+ years): Minimal growth

### Sex

Mature male turtles have long tails. In general avoid matching turtles with long tails with turtles with short ones, unless these photos were taken years apart.

### Habitat Compatibility

Check if habitat types match the species' ecology:
- Same habitat type (foraging to foraging) = High confidence
- Foraging ground to nesting beach = Compatible during breeding season
- Incompatible habitats for species = Low confidence

## STEP 5: Decision Framework

Integrate all factors to reach a conclusion:

### ✓ Answer: YES (Same Individual)

**Certainty: HIGH when:**
- Facial scale patterns clearly match with multiple distinctive features
- Same species confirmed
- Geographic distance appropriate (< 50-100 km or same location)
- Time interval 1-10 years
- Size compatible (same or increasing)
- Both images are high quality with clear scale patterns
- No conflicting metadata

**Certainty: MEDIUM when:**
- Facial scale patterns appear to match but:
  - One image has moderate quality issues
  - Time interval > 10 years (requires more careful verification)
  - Geographic distance is wider (50-500 km) but still plausible
  - Minor size discrepancies that could be measurement error
  - Missing some metadata for full verification

**Certainty: LOW when answering YES is inappropriate** - use NO with LOW certainty instead.

### ✗ Answer: NO (Different Individuals)

**Certainty: HIGH when:**
- Facial scale patterns clearly do NOT match (different arrangements)
- Different species confirmed
- Geographic distance implausible (> 1,000 km in days/weeks)
- Size decreased between photos
- Temporal impossibility (same date, distant locations)
- Both images clear enough to rule out match definitively
- Tail sizes are clearly different and photos were taken during a short interval

**Certainty: MEDIUM when:**
- Scale patterns appear different but:
  - Image quality moderate in one or both photos
  - Difficult angle or obstruction in one photo
  - Cannot see all diagnostic features clearly
  - Metadata somewhat conflicting but not definitively impossible

**Certainty: LOW when:**
- Cannot determine due to poor image quality
- Images show different sides (left vs right) without the other side for comparison
- Cannot see enough of the facial scale pattern in one or both images
- Metadata suggests different individuals but visual patterns are ambiguous
- Species identification uncertain

# CRITICAL REMINDERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- 🔑 Facial scale geometric patterns are THE definitive identifier - not color, not barnacles, not pigmentation
- ⚠️ Quality matters - blurry images cannot be reliably matched
- ⚠️ Left ≠ Right - patterns differ between sides of the same turtle
- ✓ Multi-year gaps are NORMAL - don't reject matches based on time alone
- ✓ Site fidelity is EXTREME - same location strongly supports a match
- ✓ Color changes are EXPECTED - ignore pigmentation differences
- ⚠️ When in doubt - use MEDIUM or LOW certainty and explain why expert review is needed
- ✗ Never match different species - this is impossible
- ✗ Temporary features don't count - barnacles, algae, and minor injuries change over time
- ✓ Size must be consistent - turtles don't shrink

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXAMPLE SCENARIOS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Scenario 1: Clear Match ✓

- Both images show clear lateral left profile views
- Post-ocular scale count matches (4 scales each)
- Tympanic scale pattern shows identical geometric arrangement with distinctive irregular junction in lower posterior region
- Same location (GPS within 2 km)
- 3 years apart
- Size consistent (slightly larger in later photo)
- Both images sharp and well-lit

**→ ANSWER: YES, CERTAINTY: HIGH**

## Scenario 2: Clear Non-Match ✗

- Cannot clearly see scale boundaries in Image 2
- Location suggests same individual (exact same GPS), 2 years apart

**→ ANSWER: NO, CERTAINTY: LOW**
*(Cannot confirm match due to image quality - recommend obtaining better image 2)*

## Scenario 4: Long Time Interval ⚠️

- Both images excellent quality
- Facial scale patterns appear to match in multiple distinctive features
- Same foraging ground location
- 13 years apart (long but documented as possible)
- Size increase consistent with growth

**→ ANSWER: YES, CERTAINTY: MEDIUM**
*(Pattern match strong but long interval warrants expert verification)*
